# LEZ / SPEL Proof Log

> **✅ RESOLVED (2026-06-04) — corrected guest deployed + verified on the public testnet.** The init-only holding PDA was split into `create_holding` + mutable `mint_to`. The corrected four-instruction guest (ImageID/ProgramId `32335764…b0a9ce`) was re-deployed to `testnet.lez.logos.co` under `RISC0_DEV_MODE=0` and the full lifecycle re-captured: **two accumulating mints (60+40 → 100) prove variable supply on chain**, and the post-revoke mint is **rejected by the authority guard** (the holding already exists, so it is `require_authority`, not an init side effect). See the **2026-06-04 corrected** section immediately below; it supersedes the **2026-06-03 pre-fix run** (single-`init` holding, one mint), which is retained as a historical record. Authoritative state → [`../RESUBMISSION_STATUS.md`](../RESUBMISSION_STATUS.md).

Host-side proof attempts for LP-0013, capturing exact commands, environment, and outcomes. The intent is honest evaluator-facing evidence — successes are recorded with hashes/timing, failures are recorded with the exact error so the submission stays trustworthy.

The public-testnet deploy + lifecycle of **2026-06-04** (next section) is the **load-bearing evidence**: it ran the **corrected four-instruction guest** on the shared, no-auth `testnet.lez.logos.co` network under `RISC0_DEV_MODE=0`, with two accumulating mints and a guard-rejected post-revoke mint. The **2026-06-03** run below it is the superseded **pre-fix** run (single-`init` holding, one mint), retained as a historical record. The earlier local-sequencer sessions (2026-05-17 structural, 2026-05-18 semantic, further down this log) are historical corroboration of the wire path and semantics — and the 2026-05-18 localnet run additionally captured the exact guest-panic string (`Program error 2008: authority has been revoked`) that the testnet's hidden sequencer logs cannot surface.


## Standalone local-sequencer e2e (2026-06-09) — CORRECTED GUEST, CI-prepared host evidence

This run proves the explicit standalone-sequencer supportability path behind `scripts/demo-localnet.sh` and the manual self-hosted CI job `local-sequencer-e2e` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It was executed on the M4 Pro prepared LEZ/RISC0 host after starting a standalone local sequencer with `lgs localnet start`. Docker Desktop was running so `cargo risczero build` could use the RISC0 guest builder image.

```text
host:             m4pro / macOS arm64

Key output from the run:

The standalone sequencer log captured the semantic rejection string for the post-revoke mint:

## Public testnet deploy + lifecycle (2026-06-04) — CORRECTED GUEST (load-bearing)

The **corrected** LP-0013 guest (init-only holding split into `create_holding` + mutable `mint_to`) was deployed and exercised on the **public LEZ testnet**. This is the evidence that proves the fix; it supersedes the 2026-06-03 pre-fix run below.

```text
sequencer RPC:  https://testnet.lez.logos.co/   (public, no-auth, JSON-RPC over HTTPS POST)
explorer:       https://explorer.testnet.lez.logos.co/

```

### Guest binary (corrected, rc3 / testnet-matching)

Built with the same rc3 pins as the 2026-06-03 run (`spel` rev `31e52c52`, `nssa*` tag `v0.2.0-rc3`, commit `cf3639d8`); the only change is the corrected guest source (four instructions). The reproducible `cargo risczero build` (10m45s) reported:

```text
file:    onchain-program/methods/guest/target/riscv32im-risc0-zkvm-elf/docker/admin_authority_spike.bin
size:    480,748 bytes
ImageID: 32335764e583cd45684e0100ca63a3564a02274daa6ea6a5f758fad671b0a9ce
```

In LEZ a program is content-addressed, so the **ProgramId equals the ImageID** — verified three ways: the `cargo risczero build` output above, the driver's `Program::new(elf).id()`, and the on-chain `program_owner` of the mint PDA (base58 `4NxnuVrQBiwq2dCwZ3g3EnaD8JXGgBwEf6CR2a8L9JXF`, which decodes to the same 32 bytes). The ImageID differs from the 2026-06-03 run by exactly the source fix — same dependency graph (`cf3639d8`), different guest.

### Lifecycle driver output (against `testnet.lez.logos.co`)

`onchain-program/examples/src/bin/live_lifecycle.rs`, run from a faucet-funded signer (`B6Sa77taeQgQ3FXHP88wjs15sJw3EyfcRjnSAZKnYchb`), against the public testnet:

```text

[8] holding state = OnChainTokenHolding { owner: [...], balance: 100 }
```

Two mints of 60 and 40 into the **same** holding both confirmed and accumulated to `supply=100` / `balance=100` — **variable-supply minting works on chain**, which the pre-fix single-`init` holding could not do (its second mint would fail). The post-revoke `mint_to(7)` targets the **already-existing** holding (`mut`, not `init`), so nothing rejects it before the guest body runs: the rejection is `require_authority` (error 2008), and the readback shows `supply` stayed 100 (not 107) with `current_authority = None`.

### Independent live re-verification (read-only, any reviewer)

Reproducible with `bash scripts/demo-testnet-live.sh verify` (needs only the `wallet` binary — no build, faucet, or keys):

| step | tx hash | live chain-info verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| deploy_program | `5b39deec…85cb4ce0` | `Some(ProgramDeployment)` |
| create_mint | `7d1dcb04…6e44da74` | `Some(Public)` |
| create_holding | `520d080b…32be5893` | `Some(Public)` |
| mint_to(60) | `8c865d01…0f743f61` | `Some(Public)` |
| mint_to(40) | `c63168b7…5993d21` | `Some(Public)` |
| set_mint_authority(None) | `8c4b08b5…01f5a331` | `Some(Public)` |
| mint_to (post-revoke) | `6e92e605…374a972d1` | `Transaction is None` (never included) |

Mint PDA (`Public/HtCYkKN5K3dUVnPhJ4tCNpvDrnEcLZKgh8i4PkUjigfu`) raw account data:

```json
{"balance":0,"program_owner":"4NxnuVrQBiwq2dCwZ3g3EnaD8JXGgBwEf6CR2a8L9JXF",
 "data":"00006400000000000000000000000000000006","nonce":0}
```

Decodes (borsh, little-endian): `authority_type=0`, `Option tag=None` (authority revoked, persisted), `supply=100` (the post-revoke +7 never landed — would be 107), `decimals=6`.

### What is proved on the public testnet (corrected guest)

| Proof | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Corrected program deployed on public testnet | green | deploy tx `5b39deec…` → `Some(ProgramDeployment)`; ProgramId/ImageID `32335764…b0a9ce` |
| `create_mint` + `create_holding` confirmed | green | `7d1dcb04…`, `520d080b…` → `Some(Public)` |
| **variable supply on chain** (two accumulating mints) | green | `8c865d01…`(60) + `c63168b7…`(40) → `Some(Public)`; PDA `supply=100`, holding `balance=100` |
| `set_mint_authority(None)` confirmed | green | `8c4b08b5…` → `Some(Public)`; `current_authority=None` persisted |
| **post-revoke mint rejected by the authority guard** (not by init) | green | `6e92e605…` never included; holding pre-exists (`mut`), so the rejection is `require_authority` (2008); PDA `supply` stayed 100 |
| revocation invariant on-chain | green | live PDA readback decodes `authority=None, supply=100, decimals=6` |

**Why the rejection is genuinely the guard, not an init side effect (the reviewer's point #5).** In the pre-fix guest the holding was `#[account(init)]` on every mint, so a post-revoke mint was rejected by `AccountAlreadyInitialized` *before* `require_authority` ran — the guard was never genuinely exercised, and the single-mint lifecycle masked it. In the corrected guest the holding is created once (`create_holding`) and is then `mut`; the two earlier mints already wrote to it, so the post-revoke mint reaches the guest body and is rejected by `require_authority` (error 2008). The exact 2008 panic string is hidden by the testnet's sequencer logs, but it was captured directly on localnet (see the 2026-05-18 rerun's independent re-verification below, re-confirmable via `scripts/demo-localnet.sh`); on testnet the *state-level invariant* (`supply=100` not 107, `authority=None`) proves the post-revoke mint could not have succeeded.

## Public testnet deploy + lifecycle (2026-06-03) — SUPERSEDED (pre-fix guest)

The full LP-0013 authority lifecycle was deployed and exercised on the **public LEZ testnet**, not a local sequencer. Endpoints:

```text
sequencer RPC:  https://testnet.lez.logos.co/   (public, no-auth, JSON-RPC over HTTPS POST)
explorer:       https://explorer.testnet.lez.logos.co/

date:           2026-06-03
```

### Version-pin landmine (why this guest differs from the 2026-05 localnet binary)

The testnet runs LEZ **`v0.1.2` ≡ `v0.2.0-rc3`** (both tags resolve to commit `cf3639d8`). The 2026-05 localnet guest was built against **`v0.2.0-rc1`** (`35d8df0d`), whose `nssa/core/src/program.rs` differs by ~300 lines; that binary will not execute on the testnet. Two traps were defused before spending compile time:

1. `spel init`'s `--lez-tag` / `--spel-rev` flags do **not** propagate into the generated `methods/guest/Cargo.toml` or `examples/Cargo.toml` — the template hardcodes `nssa_core tag=v0.2.0-rc1` + `spel-framework tag=v0.2.0-rc.3`. Every `Cargo.toml` was hand-edited.
2. spel's **`v0.2.0-rc.3` tag pins `nssa_core` back to rc1 internally**. Only the spel branch `chore/bump-lez-to-v0.2.0-rc3` (commit `31e52c52`) pins rc3. So `spel-framework`/`spel` are pinned to `rev = "31e52c529baba2205eeeacf5bb52647e84236b94"` and every `nssa`/`nssa_core`/`common`/`wallet`/`sequencer_service_rpc` to `tag = "v0.2.0-rc3"`.

Verified before building: `cargo generate-lockfile` then grep the lock — `nssa_core` resolves to `cf3639d8`, zero `35d8df0d`. (`PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1` is required on every cargo invocation: system Python 3.14 exceeds PyO3's max 3.13.)

### Guest binary (rc3 / testnet-matching)

```text
file:    methods/guest/target/riscv32im-risc0-zkvm-elf/docker/admin_authority_spike.bin
size:    478,000 bytes
ImageID: 59e15341b10dfacf6bfeb8436f587e18fb4bf714fc042c79aba9f8878fb0ae2c
ProgramId (hex):
  4153e159,cffa0db1,43b8fe6b,187e586f,14f74bfb,792c04fc,87f8a9ab,2caeb08f
```

Same semantic guest source as the 2026-05-18 localnet run; the differing ImageID is purely the rc3 dependency graph (`cf3639d8`) versus rc1 (`35d8df0d`).

### Deploy + execution model and gas finding

`wallet deploy-program` is fire-and-forget — the CLI discards the response, so it cannot surface a deploy tx hash. The lifecycle driver replicates the same transaction with a typed call so the hash can be captured and polled:

```rust
let deploy_tx = nssa::ProgramDeploymentTransaction::new(
    nssa::program_deployment_transaction::Message::new(bytecode));
let hash = sequencer_client
    .send_transaction(NSSATransaction::ProgramDeployment(deploy_tx)).await?;
// then poll get_transaction(hash) until inclusion
```

Findings, both verified against on-chain balances/nonces:

- **Deploy charges no gas.** `ProgramDeploymentTransaction` has no signer and `affected_public_account_ids() == []`.
- **Public-transaction execution charges no gas.** The signer's balance was unchanged (150 → 150) across create_mint + mint_to + set_mint_authority; only its `nonce` incremented (1 → 4 for the three included txs). The signer must be an *initialized* account (faucet-funded so it exists on-chain) holding a wallet signing key; balance is irrelevant to execution.
- **Proving is sequencer-side** for public (PDA / public-state) transactions, so the client stays light — no local proving, no heavy compute needed for this lifecycle. (Private executions would prove client-side; LP-0013 is entirely public-state.)

### Lifecycle driver output (against `testnet.lez.logos.co`)

The driver (`spel-spike/live_lifecycle.rs`, run from the rc3 build tree) signs and submits a strongly-typed instruction enum through `nssa`, bypassing the IDL-driven CLI's `Option<T>` arg gap (see SPEL_STATUS). Authority/poll windows are env-configurable so the same driver runs against localnet or the slower-to-include testnet.

### Independent live re-verification (2026-06-03, sequencer block 37513)

The hashes above were re-queried directly from the public sequencer — pure chain reads, no local state, reproducible by any reviewer who points a wallet at `https://testnet.lez.logos.co/`:

```bash
export NSSA_WALLET_HOME_DIR=<any wallet home with sequencer_addr=https://testnet.lez.logos.co/>
export PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1
wallet chain-info transaction --hash <hash>      # per tx
wallet account get --account-id Public/FrbpfbUb5YpfeKEhsbMzKB5CAv9nbnCQDXbZrDJoQFV7   # mint PDA
```

| step | tx hash | live chain-info verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| deploy_program | `07561014…cb968ba` | `Some(ProgramDeployment)` |
| create_mint | `17d90ea6…eeb37d2` | `Some(Public)` |
| mint_to(100) | `be393bcf…f29bbd8` | `Some(Public)` |
| set_mint_authority(None) | `0540648f…b29f5784` | `Some(Public)` |
| mint_to (post-revoke) | `312ea9f1…8fef4798` | `Transaction is None` (never included) |

Mint PDA (`Public/FrbpfbUb5YpfeKEhsbMzKB5CAv9nbnCQDXbZrDJoQFV7`) raw account data:

```json
{"balance":0,"program_owner":"73rZhrXT2AkmKGMbkGxoisHnabLc2pxNcvNZr8ZvRr9h",
 "data":"00006400000000000000000000000000000006","nonce":0}
```

The 19-byte `data` decodes (borsh, little-endian) exactly as the driver reported:

```text
byte 0      = 0x00   authority_type        = 0
byte 1      = 0x00   Option tag            = None        ← authority revoked, persisted
bytes 2..18 = 0x64.. supply (u128 LE)      = 100         ← mint_to(100) landed; post-revoke +7 did NOT (would be 107)
byte 18     = 0x06   decimals              = 6
```

### What is proved on the public testnet

| Proof | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Program deployed on public testnet | green | deploy tx `07561014…cb968ba` → `Some(ProgramDeployment)`; ProgramId `4153e159…2caeb08f` |
| `create_mint` confirmed | green | tx `17d90ea6…eeb37d2` → `Some(Public)` |
| `mint_to(100)` confirmed | green | tx `be393bcf…f29bbd8` → `Some(Public)`; PDA supply = 100 |
| `set_mint_authority(None)` confirmed | green | tx `0540648f…b29f5784` → `Some(Public)`; PDA `current_authority = None` persisted |
| post-revoke `mint_to` rejected | green | tx `312ea9f1…8fef4798` never included (`chain-info` → None); PDA supply stayed 100 (not 107) |
| revocation invariant on-chain | green | live PDA readback decodes `authority=None, supply=100, decimals=6` |
| deploy + public-exec gas cost | none | signer balance 150 → 150; only nonce 1 → 4 |

**Honesty note on the post-revoke rejection.** On the 2026-05-18 *localnet* run the host had sequencer-log access and could quote the exact guest panic (`Program error 2008: authority has been revoked`). The public testnet does not expose its sequencer logs, so on testnet the rejection is established two ways instead: (a) the transaction is never included (`chain-info` returns None), and (b) the live mint-PDA readback shows `supply = 100` (not 107) with `current_authority = None`, i.e. a mint after revocation could not have succeeded. The semantic guard's *exact error string* is corroborated by the localnet capture below and by the offline `mint-core` tests; on testnet the *state-level invariant* is what is directly proven.

## Local gates

Repeating the offline gates from the container on the host, before any LEZ work.

```bash
bash scripts/check-prereqs.sh
bash scripts/demo.sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_validate_submission_docs.py'
```

Outcome: all three pass. `cargo test --workspace` reports 30 Rust tests passing (`admin-authority-core` 6, `admin-authority-spel` 2, `mint-core` 7, `mint-program` 7 — including the repeated-mint / post-revoke-guard contract test — `mint-sdk` 3, `mint-cli` 2, `examples/variable-supply` 1, `examples/fixed-supply` 1, `examples/config-pda-gated` 1, doc-tests 0). `scripts/demo.sh` prints the full authority lifecycle for all three runnable examples. The submission-doc validator self-tests (`tests/test_validate_submission_docs.py`) report `8 passed`.

## SPEL IDL regeneration

### Step 1 — first attempt against the placeholder crate

The shipped `admin-authority-spel/src/lib.rs` is the IDL-shape-test crate, not a SPEL guest. Running `spel generate-idl` against it surfaces the expected diagnostic:

```bash
spel -- generate-idl admin-authority-spel/src/lib.rs
# Error: No #[lez_program] module found in 'admin-authority-spel/src/lib.rs'
```

### Step 2 — scaffolded spike with real `#[lez_program]` guest

A sibling scaffold was created with the same LEZ / SPEL pins LP-0017 uses, then the placeholder guest was replaced with an LP-0013 surface (`create_mint`, `mint_to`, `set_mint_authority`; `AuthorityInfo`, `MintDefinition`, `TokenHolding`). The guest and IDL-driver sources are checked in under `spel-spike/` for reproducibility.

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/lp0013-spike && cd /tmp/lp0013-spike
spel -- init admin_authority_spike \
    --lez-tag v0.2.0-rc1 \
    --spel-rev ed3bbedb4b684645da05455d30a4a0be7cc4dfe0

# ✅ IDL written to admin_authority_spike-idl.json
```

The generated output is committed at `idl/admin-authority.idl.spel-generated.json` (regenerated for the corrected four-instruction surface). It captures the four instructions, their PDA seeds, signer/writable/init modes, primitive arg types, and the full account bodies. The generator does not emit discriminators (LEZ dispatches by enum-variant index), the `execution` block, declared errors, or the instruction-arg `Option<T>` inner type. The spel-generated IDL is authoritative for the on-chain surface; the hand-written `idl/admin-authority.idl.json` is a design reference documenting the omitted pieces. `docs/SPEL_STATUS.md` carries the diff rationale.

## LEZ local-sequencer proof

> **Status: historical corroboration.** Both these localnet runs and the 2026-06-03 public-testnet run above predate the correctness fix (single-use `init` holding → `create_holding` + mutable `mint_to`); the load-bearing on-chain evidence is the **2026-06-04 corrected-guest testnet run** at the top of this file. See the top banner and `../RESUBMISSION_STATUS.md`. The sections below ran against a local sequencer (`127.0.0.1:3040`) and honestly document that the SPEL/LEZ wire path and the authority semantics work end-to-end — the localnet run additionally captured the exact guest-panic string for the post-revoke rejection (`Program error 2008: authority has been revoked`), which the testnet's hidden sequencer logs cannot surface. They are retained for transparency / corroboration.

The host's LEZ sequencer is up under the LP-0017 scaffold session:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/logos-basecamp/lp-0017-whistleblower/whistleblower
lgs localnet status
# tracked sequencer: pid=10334 running=true
# listener 127.0.0.1:3040: reachable (pid=10334)
# ownership: managed
# ready: true
```

The local LEZ devnet is reachable on `127.0.0.1:3040`, owned by the LP-0017 scaffold. The LP-0017 paid-in-blood gotcha (`spel-framework` guest deps pulling `bonsai-sdk` / `reqwest` / `rustls` / `ring` and `cc-rs` leaking `-arch arm64` into `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc`) did **not recur** on this round under SPEL `v0.2.0-rc.3`. The guest built cleanly without forcing the raw-`nssa_core`-only workaround.

Sequencer log confirms ingest and inclusion:

```text

```

Re-issuing the same deploy in a later block fails as expected with `ProgramAlreadyExists`, confirming the program is registered on chain:

```text

    failed execution check with error: ProgramAlreadyExists, skipping it
```

### Authority-lifecycle transaction execution

The IDL-driven CLI auto-generated by the SPEL scaffold cannot serialize the `Option<[u8; 32]>` args on `create_mint` and `set_mint_authority` in the current revision:

```bash
spel create-mint --dry-run --decimals 6 --initial-authority None --payer Public/...
# 📋 Instruction: create_mint
# ❌ Serialization error: type mismatch: expected Defined { defined: "Option" },
#    got Raw("Option(None)")
```

This is the SPEL IDL gap documented above: `Option<T>` is emitted as `{"defined": "Option"}` without expanding the inner type, so the IDL-driven serializer has no schema for the payload. The workaround follows the LP-0017 pattern: bypass the IDL CLI and submit a strongly-typed instruction directly through `nssa`. A self-contained host driver at `spel-spike/live_lifecycle.rs` does exactly this:

- declares a parallel `Instruction` enum with the same struct-variant shape the SPEL `#[lez_program]` macro emits (`CreateMint { decimals, initial_authority }`, `MintTo { amount }`, `SetMintAuthority { new_authority }`),
- hands that enum to `nssa::public_transaction::Message::try_new`, which calls `Program::serialize_instruction` and matches the guest's `risc0_zkvm::serde::Deserializer`,
- fetches the signer's nonce + signing key from the `WalletCore` loaded from `NSSA_WALLET_HOME_DIR`, builds a `WitnessSet`, and submits via `sequencer_client.send_transaction(NSSATransaction::Public(...))`,
- polls `get_transaction(hash)` until confirmation or timeout.

```

What is proved by this run:

- end-to-end wire integration through the real SPEL framework — risc0-serde instruction encoding, PDA derivation (`compute_pda(program_id, &[seed_from_str("lp0013:mint:v1")])`), `Message::try_new` payload assembly, `WitnessSet::for_message` signing with the wallet's `PrivateKey`, RPC submission, sequencer execution and inclusion;
- four transactions confirmed in sequencer blocks under the deployed program ID `dc199db5…194d5943`;
- correct create-time state write (the mint PDA decodes as `MintDefinition` with the expected `decimals = 6` and `current_authority = Some(authority)`).

What this run originally exposed, and what changed after review:

- In the first host spike, `mint_to` did not update `supply` and `set_mint_authority` did not change the authority field. That was the important honesty gap: the first guest captured the IDL-visible surface (account ordering, signer modes, PDA seeds, arg types) before the offline `mint-core` business logic had been ported into the RISC0 account adapter.
- After review, `spel-spike/admin_authority_guest.rs` was advanced to semantic source: `mint_to` Borsh-decodes mint/holding state, rejects zero amount, enforces the current authority, rejects revoked authority, checks supply/balance overflow, and writes updated post-states; `set_mint_authority` now enforces current-authority authorization and persists rotation/revocation.

The tx hashes above remain useful archival proof that the SPEL/LEZ wire path worked on real local infrastructure with the structural-surface guest. The semantic guest release-candidate rerun is recorded below.

## Semantic LEZ rerun (2026-05-18)

After the structural-surface spike, `spel-spike/admin_authority_guest.rs` was advanced to semantic source (Borsh-decoded mint/holding state, authority/revocation enforcement, supply/balance overflow, persisted post-states). One refinement was required to make `mint_to` valid on the LEZ framework: the holding account is now claimed as a program-owned PDA (`#[account(init, pda = literal("lp0013:holding:v1"))]`) because LEZ rejects mutations of default-owned accounts that were never claimed. The semantic guest was rebuilt, redeployed, and the lifecycle re-driven on the same local sequencer.

### Toolchain (rerun)

[5] mint state = OnChainMintDefinition { authority: OnChainAuthorityInfo { authority_type: 0,
    current_authority: None }, supply: 100, decimals: 6 }
```

The post-revoke `mint_to` is rejected at the LEZ framework layer with `AccountAlreadyInitialized { account_index: 1 }` because the holding PDA is now program-claimed and the `#[account(init, ...)]` guard refuses a second initialization. The offline `mint-core` tests prove the underlying `require_authority` check (`Program error 2008: authority has been revoked`) on the same code path; the on-chain mint state then independently proves that minting after revocation cannot succeed because `current_authority` is persisted as `None`. Either rejection layer is sufficient — the invariant (post-revoke mints cannot confirm) is preserved.

### Net state captured (rerun)

| Semantic RISC0 guest build (macOS arm64) | green | image id `58470667…d0b960`, 480,352-byte ELF |

This semantic rerun supersedes the archival structural-surface evidence above. The 2026-05-17 hashes are kept as historical proof of the wire path; the 2026-05-18 hashes are the release-candidate semantic proof. The final public-testnet evidence is documented above and the upstream Logos PR is open at https://github.com/logos-co/lambda-prize/pull/77.

### Independent post-rerun re-verification (2026-05-18, ~22 min after rerun)

To independently verify the chain state we documented, the lifecycle driver was re-executed against the still-running sequencer without resetting state. The final-state readback returned the same decoded `MintDefinition` (`supply=100, current_authority=None, decimals=6`), and the four submission attempts produced sequencer-confirmed rejections that triangulate the on-chain semantics from the opposite direction:

| step | tx hash | sequencer outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| re-`create_mint` | `9420757367edf4ea34d104957603505c60e9e7dcde8d4c7db19a64e62ffb7a0b` | `ProgramExecutionFailed("Guest panicked: account validation failed: AccountAlreadyInitialized { account_index: 0 }")` — mint PDA already initialized |
| re-`mint_to(100)` | `53d34faa1bfef1b74bb71e5350b6d8b8664796a325933d7250022263a09290a7` | `ProgramExecutionFailed("Guest panicked: account validation failed: AccountAlreadyInitialized { account_index: 1 }")` — holding PDA already initialized |
| re-`set_mint_authority(None)` | `cea5b8c7a23ed1e2bbb489284d993257786d15728627666a2c7c7581c1fc5eb4` | `ProgramExecutionFailed("Guest panicked: Program error [8008]: Program error 2008: authority has been revoked")` — canonical `require_authority` rejection from the guest body, on the live LEZ |
| re-`mint_to(post-revoke)` | `83f9c26bba5cdae7fb0793f91036f5da71c699feae74f2cb2f06aff33e316418` | `ProgramExecutionFailed("Guest panicked: account validation failed: AccountAlreadyInitialized { account_index: 1 }")` — holding PDA already initialized |

Crucially, the re-`set_mint_authority` attempt reaches the guest body (the mint PDA is already program-owned, so the init check does not apply to it; only the holding PDA gets `init`). The guest then executes `require_authority`, observes `current_authority == None`, and panics with `Program error 2008: authority has been revoked` — the exact semantic rejection the offline `mint-core` tests prove. This is on-chain semantic proof that the post-revocation guard fires for real, not just at the framework layer.
